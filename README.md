# üåç New Jersey Energy Portal

Project Overview
The New Jersey Energy Portal will be designed to help individuals to understand the energy consumption and energy burdens through the different socio-economic groups. By providing interactive tools like maps and calculators, the users will be able to visualize energy use and make informed decisions about switching to clean energy.

## üîÄ Branch Structure

This repo is organized into multiple branches to keep code and data modular and clean:

### `main`
- Contains all **core files**:
  - HTML (e.g. `index.html`, `municipal-map.html`)
  - CSS and JS
  - PHP back-end scripts
- These files power the interactive web portal and load data dynamically.

### `datasets`
- Stores **CSV files** that were used during research or for UI filters:
  - Examples include electricity/natural gas data, tenure, heating types, etc.
  - Some CSVs were referenced but not directly used in the final version.
- This branch helps document data considered during development.

### `geojson-data`
- Contains **local GeoJSON boundary files** for municipalities and counties.
- Some of these were used directly in the portal; others were replaced with external ArcGIS links.
- Useful for backup or offline use.
